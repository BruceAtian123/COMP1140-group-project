Review Comments:

1. She usually transform ArrayList to Array throughout the assignment and rarely use Linked List, however it should be used depend on the situations. 
2. She generally did well in all tasks, however because of the lack of the comments(mainly in AI part), I rarely understand her code and make it hard to implement in Viewer.
3. The GetBloom function in BloomsGame can be simplified as the checklists are all pretty long everytime, so same situation might be checked multiple times which may affect the efficiency of the function.

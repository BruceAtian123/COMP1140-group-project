Review Comments:

1. He takes care of all JavaFX sections and make a good game platform. However, in Class Viewer line 138 - 249, he enumerates all cases for every possible stone placements for board size 4. I think we should make a board that can be generated by a given size. Also the positions should related to board size and space number. Board is not general enough and only works on one size board. But due to my limited ability on JavaFX I could not find a solution for this problem.
2. In Class Placement, getNeighbours has been written really simple and efficiently. However, due to simple names of variable and comments, I could not fully understand the codes and concepts by myself. Similar problem in isFenced function in Class BloomsGame.

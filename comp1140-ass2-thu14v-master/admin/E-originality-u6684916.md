following documented exceptions:

The Node(Tree) structure and two methods(addChild and addChildren) in class Node is based on a solution I found when researching about tree structure. url: https://www.javagists.com/java-tree-data-structure

The minimax and abPruning methods are learnt from Wikipedia and the pseudocode provided online.

The code in all tests I written uses ideas from other given tests and examples provided in lectures.

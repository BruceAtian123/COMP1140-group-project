I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method generateTree() in class ComputerPlayer().
* The method getScore() in class Board().
* The method getBloom() in class BloomsGame().

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

  The Node(Tree) structure and two methods(addChild and addChildren) in class Node is based on a solution I found when researching about tree structure. url: https://www.javagists.com/java-tree-data-structure

  The minimax and abPruning methods are learnt from Wikipedia and the pseudocode provided online.

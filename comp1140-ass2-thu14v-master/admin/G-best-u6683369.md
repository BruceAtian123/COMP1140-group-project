I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method makeControls() in class SinglePlayer().
* The method getNeighbours() in class Placement().
* The method isFenced() in class BloomsGame().

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of make coordinates and map came from the website given by the assignment page.

* The idea of make slider came from the oracle javafx tutorial

* How to play sound loop learnt from stackoverflow

* How to set text learnt from oracle javafx tutorial

* How to set slider bar learnt from oracle javafx tutorial, also you can find similar difficulty setting in comp1110 assignment1

* Makestones idea is taken from assignment 1's tilecode, the actual index(not the int index that I used before) is the combination of
  numbers and letters similar to assignment1's tile position and direction
